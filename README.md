## The Shiny App: Next Word Predictor

This Shiny app is developed as a capstone project to complete Coursera Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University in collaboration with Swiftkey. The goals are to build a predictive text model (like those used by SwiftKey) from unstructured text documents and then to develop it into a Shiny app for end users.

The predictive model is built from the text corpora (a body of texts) provided by Coursera. It uses a simple Stupid Backoff algorithm.

The model file will be available after the course ends.
